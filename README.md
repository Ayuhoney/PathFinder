# PathFinder

PathFinder was created in order to provide an all-inclusive travel application. We wanted to take commonly requested information (popular restaurants, tourist attractions, weather, etc.) and display it all in an easily digestible way.

Pathfinder was created with the following tools:

Dikastra Algorithm
jQuery
Google Maps API
OpenWeather Map API
Eventful API
